# Abstact 
Safety of the intended functionality is one of the biggest problems in the research and the commercialization of autonomous vehicles, and the difficulty of safety of the intended functionality is that machine needs to prevent potential dangerous behaviors caused by functional insufficiencies of the intended functionality. It is a vital choice to improve safety of the intended functionality by designing a human-centred intelligent system, However the mental activities of passengers in highly automated driving scenarios has not been adequately explored. Herein, we build a fNIRS dataset of passengers in fourteen kinds of highly automated driving scenarios, which considers age,  sex and driving experience factors. This dataset focus on the raw data of cerebral oxy-haemoglobin change and deoxy-haemoglobin change in prefrontal cortex, and it provides a data support for analyzing the driving risk cognition of passengers in highly automated driving scenarios, and a possible to improve safety of the intended
functionality by using the mental activities of the most advanced senor-human.
